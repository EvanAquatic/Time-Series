plot(lynx)
length(lynx) #114 observations
#some autocorrelation might be present --> repetitive pattern
#not seasonal one observation per year

plot(LakeHuron)
length(LakeHuron) #98 observations
#Annual measurements (1875-1973) of Lake Huron water levels in feet
#Annual data-->non-seasonal
#Plot looks like a random walk (very little pattern)

plot(nottem)
length(nottem) #240 observations
#Temp measurements (F) for 1920-1940 in Nottingham
#Monthly dataset with 240 observations 
#There is no trend or change in variance
#A really good example for seasonal data

plot(AirPassengers)
length(AirPassengers) #144 observations
#Several statistical trails influence the pattern; Trend; Seasonality, and Trend within the seasons

length(EuStockMarkets) #7440 observations
#The major stock indices in Europe for 1991-1999
#Multivariate time series data

length(sunspot.year) #289 observations
#Yearly data for 1700-1989
#Autocorrelation might be present
